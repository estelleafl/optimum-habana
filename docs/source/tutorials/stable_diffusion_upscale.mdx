# Super-resolution

The Stable Diffusion upscaler diffusion model was created by the researchers and engineers from CompVis, Stability AI, and LAION. It is used to enhance the resolution of input images by a factor of 4.

See [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion/upscale) for more information

## How to upscale low resolution images?

To generate RGB and depth images with Stable Diffusion Upscale on Gaudi, you need to instantiate two instances:
- A pipeline with [`GaudiStableDiffusionUpscalePipeline`]. 
- A scheduler with [`GaudiDDIMScheduler`](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/habana/package_reference/stable_diffusion_pipeline#optimum.habana.diffusers.GaudiDDIMScheduler). This scheduler has been optimized for Gaudi.

When initializing the pipeline, you have to specify `use_habana=True` to deploy it on HPUs.
Furthermore, to get the fastest possible generations you should enable **HPU graphs** with `use_hpu_graphs=True`.
Finally, you will need to specify a [Gaudi configuration](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/habana/package_reference/gaudi_config) which can be downloaded from the Hugging Face Hub.

```python
import requests
from io import BytesIO
from optimum.habana.diffusers import (
    GaudiDDIMScheduler,
    GaudiStableDiffusionUpscalePipeline,
)
from optimum.habana.utils import set_seed
from PIL import Image

set_seed(42)

model_name_upscale = "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-x4-upscaler"
scheduler = GaudiDDIMScheduler.from_pretrained(model_name_upscale, subfolder="scheduler")
url = "https://huggingface.co/datasets/hf-internal-testing/diffusers-images/resolve/main/sd2-upscale/low_res_cat.png"
response = requests.get(url)
low_res_img = Image.open(BytesIO(response.content)).convert("RGB")
low_res_img = low_res_img.resize((128, 128))
low_res_img.save("low_res_cat.png")
prompt = "a white cat"

pipeline = GaudiStableDiffusionUpscalePipeline.from_pretrained(
    model_name_upscale,
    scheduler=scheduler,   #TODO shceduler? Karras??
    use_habana=True,
    use_hpu_graphs=True,
    gaudi_config="Habana/stable-diffusion",
)
upscaled_image = pipeline(prompt=prompt, image=low_res_img).images[0]
upscaled_image.save("upsampled_cat.png")

```
